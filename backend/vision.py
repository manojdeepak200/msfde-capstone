"""Damage photograph analysis with a vision model.

Content Understanding gives grounded field extraction for documents. Photographs are
different: there is no text to ground against, so a vision model describes what is visible
and estimates a repair band. The band is what later lets the pipeline notice that a $6,940
estimate does not match a light scuff.

# TODO 2: write the instructions for assessing a damage photograph.
#
# The assessment feeds a rule that compares the repair estimate against what the photo
# actually shows, so it must be conservative and specific:
#   - describe only what is visible; never infer a cause or who was at fault
#   - never guess at damage that is out of frame
#   - say "None visible" when there is no damage in the image
#   - map the visible damage to one of the indicative bands in CIP-CLM-220 section 4
#     (read reference/policies/CIP-CLM-220 - the bands are in the table in section 4)

    "or who is responsible. Do not guess at damage that is outside the frame or hidden by glare, "
    "shadows, distance, or obstructions. If there is no visible damage, return 'None visible'. "
    "Identify the affected area from the standard options: Front, Rear, Side, Roof, Glass, "
    "Underbody, Multiple, or None visible. Choose the severity from: none, minor, moderate, "
    "severe. In 'visible_damage', write a single sentence describing the actual damage seen, such as "
    "'minor scuff and shallow scratch on the right side door' or 'no visible damage'. "
    "Map the visible damage to the closest indicative repair band from CIP-CLM-220 section 4, using "
    "only these values: 300-900, 600-1600, 1500-3200, 2500-7000, 3000-8000, or unknown. "
    "Use the lower band if the visible damage is light and the higher band only when the damage is "
    "clearly more extensive. Set 'panel_replacement_likely' to true only when a panel or bumper "
    "cover appears likely to require replacement based on the visible damage, otherwise false. "
    "In 'notes', add a brief caution that this is a visual assessment based only on the photograph, "
    "not a causal determination or a full repair estimate."
